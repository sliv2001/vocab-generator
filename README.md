### Vocabulary generator

This is rather simple project, which uses Wolfram Mathematica to create a new unique fictional vocabulary based on any language Wolfram supports. It uses some probablistic methods like Markov's chains (when you set step=1), random number generation with custon distribution conditional probabilities and stuff like that.
